# Genetic_Neural_Network
This repository contains a Neural Network implementation using Genetic Algorithm. 

# How to use
1. git clone https://github.com/ShirAmit96/Genetic_Neural_Network.git
2. cd Genetic_Neural_Network
3. Run the desired program.
4. If you run buildnet you need to proivde the paths of the test and train files, if you run runnet you need to provide the path to the test file.

# Files 
`wnet0.txt` - The weights of the Neural Network after the training. 
`wnet1.txt` - The weights of the Neural Network after the training. 
`train0.txt` - Data used for training wnet0. 
`train1.txt` - Data used for training wnet1.
