# Genetic_Neural_Network
This repository contains a Neural Network implementation using Genetic Algorithm. 

# How to use
Download the exe files in this repository.
Make sure you place the exe files at the same directory as the data files. The files names needs to be as described in the Files section.
Double click on the desired file to run (`buildnet0.exe`\`buildnet1.exe`\`runnet0.exe`\`runnet1.exe`)

# Files 
`wnet0.txt` - The weights of the Neural Network after the training - results of `buildnet0`. 

`wnet1.txt` - The weights of the Neural Network after the training - results of `buildnet1`. 

`train0.txt` - Data used for training wnet0. 

`train1.txt` - Data used for training wnet1. 

`test0.txt` - Data used for testing wnet0 when building the model. 

`test1.txt` - Data used for testing wnet1 when building the model. 

`testnet0.txt` - Data used for testing wnet0 when testing the model - for `runnet0`. 

`testnet1.txt` - Data used for testing wnet1 when testing the model - for `runnet1`.
