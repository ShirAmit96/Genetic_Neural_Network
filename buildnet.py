# Init a  population of neural network - aka weights.
# The nn is 2-3 layers - random between 2-4
# The size of each layer also a random parameter - 5-10
# Activation function - sigmoid
# Train the nn
# fitness = evaluation the nn using the loss function
# Use GA to make changes in the weights - instead of back propagation - mutation, crossover, elitism.
# Choose the model weights and structure using the test set.
